# Terminal Tables

This is a tool (with both C and Bash versions) for drawing nice ANSI tables in the terminal. By passing in JSON for the layout, and separately JSON for the data, a table is generated that can include titles, footers, column headers, break lines, summary calculations and more.

 *Example demonstrating many of Terminal Tables' core features*
